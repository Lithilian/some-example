there once was a rabbit named Jim.
his friends usually called him Jimbo.
One day the rabbit wanted to cross the road.
So he waited untill there were no cars in sight and tried to cross the road.
He had, however, miscalculated and died a slow and horrible death because his hind legs had been run over.

The End.
